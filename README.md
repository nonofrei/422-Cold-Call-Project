422 Cold Call Project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 0: Prerequisites

Before attempting to download and run the Cold-Call Assist software, ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met. This software was built and tested using Macintosh OSX 10.13 (High Sierra) and 10.14 (Mojave). Therefore, these are the only officially supported Operating Systems. However, in general, we suspect that any MacOS version superseding the versions listed here will work accordingly with the Cold-Call Assist software. Furthermore, since MacOS is a unix based operating system, Linux based distros are also expected to perform appropriately. However, to restate: these other operating systems are not officially supported.

Warning: This software will not work on the Windows Operating System.

Step 1: Download the .zip file

First, download the .zip file containing the source code for the project. Move the file to the desired location on your local computer. Unzip the file and ensure that the following files exist:
ColdCallOperation.py ImportAndExport.py Testing.py README.md
If all the files are present then you are ready to proceed to step 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Python 3

For this step we recommend python 3.7 or newer. To download python 3 on your local machine visit the following website and follow the instructions listed there.

Step 3: Running the Software

First open the terminal application. This can be accomplished either through the launchpad or by pressing “command + Spacebar” and searching for the terminal.

After opening the terminal, we next need to navigate to the location of the folder containing the three files in Step 1. To navigate the terminal, typing the command “ls” followed by “enter” will show you all the available folders. To switch to a folder, type “cd” followed by the name of the folder. These commands are shown in the screenshot below. After switching to a new folder we can again type “ls” to see the new list of folders and files that are available. You will know you have entered the correct folder when you see the three files in Step 1 displayed after you type the command “ls”. While attempting to navigate to the correct folder if you encounter any problems visit
                                          https://appletoolbox.com/navigate-folders-using-the-mac-terminal/
which provides an excellent guide on how to navigate folders via the MacOS terminal.
Once at the terminal and in the folder, type in “python3 ColdCallOperation.py” to start the application. The main menu screen should appear in the top right corner of your display in under a second.
